## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS variables and Flexbox
- I was going to use sass but decided not to.

### What I learned

I am still learning flexbox so this helped me use it in a practical way. This project is pretty simple so it was easy enough.

### Continued development

I think this component is pretty much finished, exept if anyone has any suggestions I can impliment them.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me because I am still learning flexbox and needed clarification on some properties.
